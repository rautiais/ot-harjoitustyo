## The Use of LLMs in this Project

I used Microsoft Copilot (specifically Claude 3.5 Sonnet) while creating this project. I used it at the beginning to help with setting up the architecture of the project, and then, especially with creating the UI functionalities (login_view.py, logged_in_view.py, registration_view.py) and when connecting database to the project. I used Copilot also when creating the team, player and game functionalities. I also asked for help from Copilot when I got stuck fixing a bug.
