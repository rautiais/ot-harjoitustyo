## The Use of LLMs in this Project

I used Microsoft Copilot (specifically the Claude 3.5 Sonnet) while creating this project. I used it in the beginning to help with setting up the architecture of the project and then especially, with creating the UI functionalities (login_view.py, logged_in_view.py, registration_view.py). I also asked help from Copilot when I got stuck with fixing a bug.
